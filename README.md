#  SIME – Symbolic Interpretation of Meaning and Emotion

**Experimental symbolic-emotional system.**  
Tested, documented, and mathematically validated.

## 🔍 What is SIME?

SIME (Sistema d'Interpretació Matemàtica Emocional) is a formal symbolic framework designed to interpret texts emotionally and conceptually. It goes beyond traditional sentiment analysis by translating meaning into **symbolic-emotional formulas**, revealing **conflicts, tensions, balances, and symbolic structures** behind any human expression.
